	* Converted locallang to XML, small adaptions to syext location.
	* One slight fix to the SQL check in the BE module (wrong output if
	an error occurred).

2005-12-26  Karsten Dambekalns <karsten@typo3.org>

	* Code cleanup and improvements to the mapping. Merged 3rd
	party changes done by DIACC GmbH.

2005-12-23  Karsten Dambekalns <karsten@typo3.org>

	* Fixed a few issues that were left undiscovered yet.
	* Added a new module to test query building and parsing
	from the DBAL debug module.
	* Finalized fix for bug #1649.

2005-12-22  Karsten Dambekalns <karsten@typo3.org>

	* Fixed bug #2077 (NOT handling breaking, consequently
	discarding WHERE clauses).

2005-12-21  Karsten Dambekalns <karsten@typo3.org>

	* Fixed bug #1781 to allow easier install.
	* Closed bug #1204 as not reproducable. Probably rather a
	PHP/Apache bug than a DBAL bug.
	* Closed bug #1317 which has been fixed earlier. It was due
	to a msissing check for the incoming SQL (string/array) in the
	native part of exec_UPDATEquery().
	* Fixed parseFieldDef() t3lib_sqlparser to allow datatypes
	with just a trailing comma (like in "tyinytext," as opposed
	to "varchar(19)". This prevented installation of some
	extensions.
	* Fixed bug #2072.
	* Fixed bug #1206.
	* Fixed a bug with error logging and array queries (BLOB).
	* Prepared a fix for bug #1649, pending core list approval.
	* Fixed a bug in t3lib_page, getMultipleGroupsWhereClause()
	where double quotes were used to quote a literal for use in
	SQL. THIS IS MYSQL-ONLY! NEVER DO THIS! ALWAYS USE SINGLE
	QUOTES!

	Documentation update.

2005-05-19  Karsten Dambekalns <karsten@typo3.org>

	Committed changes to go along with the library removal done
	earlier. Completed debug logging.

2005-02-07  Karsten Dambekalns <karsten@typo3.org>

	Bringing the DBAL extension AS OF JANUARY 2005 into CVS.  Works
	pretty well, but still needs more work. A few optimizations are
	planned and some bugs in native mode need to be fixed. Checking
	this in is (similar to yesterday's commit) more for
	historic/archival reasons.  This version will NOT work with 3.7.x.
	You have been warned.

2005-02-06  Karsten Dambekalns <karsten@typo3.org>

	Bringing the DBAL extension AS OF JULY 2004 into CVS. This is
	rather for historic purposes, more changes will follow in the near
	future.  This version was already a huge step forward, but it will
	not work as expected with 3.7.x or 3.8.x. You have been warned.
