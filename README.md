# TYPO3 extension `dbal`

This extension includes an extended way for the `TYPO3_DB` database connection
class to connect to databases like MSSQL, PostgreSQL and Oracle.

The functionality was part of the TYPO3 Core, until TYPO3 v8.4, and moved into
its own extension, receiving its own public repository. It is shipped as is.
