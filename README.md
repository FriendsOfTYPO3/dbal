# TYPO3 Extension "dbal"

Includes an extended way for the "TYPO3_DB" Database Connection class which allows
to connect to databases like MSSQL, PostgreSQL and Oracle.

The functionality was part of the TYPO3 Core, until TYPO3 v8.4, and moved into its
own extension, receiving its own public repository.

## Installation
The latest version can be installed via TER (http://typo3.org) or via composer
by adding ''composer require friendsoftypo3/dbal'' in a TYPO3 v8.4+ installation.

## Current state
This extension provides an extension to TYPO3_DB and needs the EXT:adodb extension
which can also be found in TER or via composer. It is shipped as is.

## Contribution
Feel free to submit any pull request, or add documentation, tests, as you please.
We will publish a new version every once in a while, depending on the amount of changes
and pull requests submitted.

### License
The extension is published under GPL v2+, all included third-party libraries are
published under their respective licenses.

### Authors
Over a dozen contributors have been working on this area while this functionality was part of
the TYPO3 Core. This package is now maintained by a loose group of TYPO3 enthusiasts inside
the TYPO3 Community. Feel free to contact Benni Mack (benni.mack@typo3.org) for any questions
regarding "dbal".
